- Created entry files:
  - index.html (HTML entry point)
  - src/main.tsx (React entry point)
  - src/App.tsx (Main app component)
  - src/index.css (Tailwind CSS imports)
- Updated package.json with proper scripts:
  - npm run dev (start dev server)
  - npm run build (build for production)
  - npm run test (run tests)
  - npm run test:unit (run unit tests only)
  - npm run test:property (run property tests only)
  - npm run test:coverage (run tests with coverage)
- Verified Vitest runs successfully
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 2.1 - Create basic type definitions


## Task 2.1: Create basic type definitions - COMPLETED

- Created src/engine/types.ts with all core type definitions:
  - CellAddress interface (col, row)
  - CellError type (ERR, CYC)
  - CellValue type (number | string | CellError)
  - ASTNode type (number, cellRef, range, binaryOp, function)
  - CellData interface (rawContent, parsedFormula, evaluatedValue, dependencies)
  - ParseResult type (success/failure)
  - EvaluationResult type (success/failure)
  - Helper functions: isError, createError, createCycleError
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 2.2 - Implement address conversion utilities


## Task 2.2: Implement address conversion utilities - COMPLETED

- Created src/utils/address.ts with:
  - parseAddress function: converts string (e.g., "A1") to CellAddress
  - formatAddress function: converts CellAddress to string
  - Validates column range (A-J) and row range (1-20)
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 2.3 - Create unit tests for address conversion


## Task 2.3: Create unit tests for address conversion - COMPLETED

- Created tests/engine/address.test.ts with comprehensive tests:
  - Valid address parsing (A1, J20, B5)
  - Invalid address rejection (K1, A21, A0, Z99, etc.)
  - Address formatting
  - Round-trip conversion consistency
- Fixed vitest.config.ts to use 'node' environment instead of 'jsdom' to avoid ES module issues
- All 7 tests pass successfully
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 2.4 - Create SpreadsheetEngine basic structure


## Task 2.4: Create SpreadsheetEngine basic structure - COMPLETED

- Created src/engine/engine.ts with SpreadsheetEngine class:
  - cells Map for storing cell data
  - setCellContent method (basic implementation)
  - getCellValue method
  - getCellDisplayValue method (formats errors as #ERR, #CYC)
  - recalculate method stub (to be implemented later)
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 3.1 - Implement FormulaParser class
