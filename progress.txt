Next task: Task 2.1 - Create basic type definitions


## Task 2.1: Create basic type definitions - COMPLETED

- Created src/engine/types.ts with all core type definitions:
  - CellAddress interface (col, row)
  - CellError type (ERR, CYC)
  - CellValue type (number | string | CellError)
  - ASTNode type (number, cellRef, range, binaryOp, function)
  - CellData interface (rawContent, parsedFormula, evaluatedValue, dependencies)
  - ParseResult type (success/failure)
  - EvaluationResult type (success/failure)
  - Helper functions: isError, createError, createCycleError
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 2.2 - Implement address conversion utilities


## Task 2.2: Implement address conversion utilities - COMPLETED

- Created src/utils/address.ts with:
  - parseAddress function: converts string (e.g., "A1") to CellAddress
  - formatAddress function: converts CellAddress to string
  - Validates column range (A-J) and row range (1-20)
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 2.3 - Create unit tests for address conversion


## Task 2.3: Create unit tests for address conversion - COMPLETED

- Created tests/engine/address.test.ts with comprehensive tests:
  - Valid address parsing (A1, J20, B5)
  - Invalid address rejection (K1, A21, A0, Z99, etc.)
  - Address formatting
  - Round-trip conversion consistency
- Fixed vitest.config.ts to use 'node' environment instead of 'jsdom' to avoid ES module issues
- All 7 tests pass successfully
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 2.4 - Create SpreadsheetEngine basic structure


## Task 2.4: Create SpreadsheetEngine basic structure - COMPLETED

- Created src/engine/engine.ts with SpreadsheetEngine class:
  - cells Map for storing cell data
  - setCellContent method (basic implementation)
  - getCellValue method
  - getCellDisplayValue method (formats errors as #ERR, #CYC)
  - recalculate method stub (to be implemented later)
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 3.1 - Implement FormulaParser class


## Task 3.1: Implement FormulaParser class - COMPLETED

- Created src/engine/parser.ts with FormulaParser class:
  - parse method: validates formula starts with '=' and parses expression
  - Recursive descent parser with operator precedence (*, / before +, -)
  - parseExpression, parseAddSub, parseMulDiv, parsePrimary methods
  - Supports numbers (including decimals)
  - Supports binary operators: +, -, *, /
  - Supports cell references (A1 format)
  - Supports ranges (A1:B5 format)
  - Supports functions: SUM, AVG (case-insensitive)
  - Supports parentheses for grouping
  - Returns ParseResult with success/failure and AST or error message
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 3.2 - Create property tests for parser


## Task 3.2: Create property tests for parser - COMPLETED

- Created tests/properties/parser.property.test.ts with property-based tests:
  - Property 8: Input classification accuracy (formulas vs literals)
  - Property 9: Arithmetic operator parsing (+, -, *, /)
  - Property 10: Syntax error detection
  - Property 13: Range notation parsing (A1:B5 format)
- Each property test runs 100 iterations with random inputs
- Fixed package.json test:property script to use file path filter
- Moved all source files from /workspaces/kiro-ralph/src to /workspaces/kiro-ralph/excel-lite/src
- Moved all test files from /workspaces/kiro-ralph/tests to /workspaces/kiro-ralph/excel-lite/tests
- All 4 property tests pass successfully
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 3.3 - Create unit tests for parser


## Task 3.3: Create unit tests for parser - COMPLETED

- Created tests/engine/parser.test.ts with comprehensive unit tests:
  - Formula recognition (starts with =)
  - Number literals (integers, decimals)
  - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
  - Operator precedence and parentheses
  - Cell references (A1, B2, etc.)
  - Range notation (A1:B5)
  - Functions (SUM, AVG, case-insensitive)
  - Error cases (empty formula, invalid syntax, unmatched parentheses, invalid references, unknown functions)
  - Complex expressions (nested operations, multiple functions)
- All 28 unit tests pass successfully
- Total: 115 tests passing across all test files
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 4.1 - Implement CellEvaluator class


## Task 4.1: Implement CellEvaluator class - COMPLETED

- Created src/engine/evaluator.ts with CellEvaluator class:
  - evaluate method: evaluates AST and returns EvaluationResult
  - evaluateNode method: recursive evaluation of AST nodes
  - Supports number literals
  - Supports cell references (empty cells treated as 0)
  - Supports binary operators (+, -, *, /)
  - Supports SUM and AVG functions with range arguments
  - Error propagation from referenced cells
  - Division by zero error handling
  - Non-numeric values ignored in functions
- EvaluationContext interface for cell value retrieval
- Committed changes to git

Next task: Task 4.2 - Create property tests for evaluator
